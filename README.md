# Walmart Sales Data Analysis

## About

This project aims to explore Walmart's sales data to understand the top-performing branches and products, sales trends of different products, and customer behavior. The goal is to study how sales strategies can be improved and optimized. The dataset was obtained from the [Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting).

"In this recruiting competition, job-seekers are provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains many departments, and participants must project the sales for each department in each store. To add to the challenge, selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset. These markdowns are known to affect sales, but it is challenging to predict which departments are affected and to what extent."

## Purpose of the Project

The main objective of this project is to gain insight into Walmartâ€™s sales data to understand the different factors that affect sales across various branches.

## Data Overview

The dataset, obtained from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition, contains sales transactions from three different Walmart branches located in Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw. The data includes 17 columns and 1,000 rows:

## Analysis List

1. **Product Analysis**
   - Analyze different product lines to identify top performers and areas for improvement.

2. **Sales Analysis**
   - Explore sales trends of products to evaluate the effectiveness of current sales strategies and recommend modifications to increase sales.

3. **Customer Analysis**
   - Segment customers to understand purchase patterns and profitability of each segment.

## Approach Used

1. **Data Wrangling**: The first step involves inspecting the data to ensure there are no **NULL** values or missing data. If any are found, appropriate methods are used to replace or filter out the missing data.
   - A database is built.
   - Tables are created, and the data is inserted.
   - **NOT NULL** constraints ensure there are no NULL values.

2. **Feature Engineering**: New columns are generated from existing ones to provide deeper insights.
   - A `time_of_day` column is added to categorize sales into Morning, Afternoon, and Evening.
   - A `day_name` column is added to extract the day of the week for each transaction.
   - A `month_name` column is added to extract the month of the year for each transaction.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA is conducted to answer key business questions and provide insights.

## Revenue and Profit Calculations

- **COGS** (Cost of Goods Sold) = `unit_price * quantity`
- **VAT** = `5% * COGS`

VAT is added to the COGS to determine the total amount billed to the customer.

- **Total (gross_sales)** = `VAT + COGS`
- **Gross Profit (gross_income)** = `total (gross_sales) - COGS`
- **Gross Margin Percentage** = `(gross_income / total revenue)`

### Example:

- **Unit Price** = 45.79
- **Quantity** = 7

   COGS = 45.79 * 7 = 320.53
   VAT = 5% * 320.53 = 16.0265
   Total = 320.53 + 16.0265 = 336.5565
   Gross Margin Percentage = 4.76%
